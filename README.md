The good thing about a teacher is that the teacher pushes you in directions that you would never even know that excisted before you met the teacher. May the sprit of butoh invade your random number generator.

Be careful. This has been designed to be hypnotic. Only listen at a safe place. Google Milton Erickson, David Snyder before use

score.yaml is the score I use at this moment for my own research. It is a body-only score. Maybe you could call it context-free butoh. I use it as one layer, sometimes with music, sometimes with any activity. It makes me move in ways I have never moved before - ;) - see. Artificial Teachers and body intelligence.
